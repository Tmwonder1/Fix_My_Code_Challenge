# Fix_My_Code_Challenge


## Introduction
Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge! This challenge is designed to test and enhance your debugging skills. Each exercise contains a piece of code that is not working as expected. Your task is to identify the errors, fix them, and make the code run correctly.

## Objective
- Improve your understanding of common programming mistakes.
- Enhance your debugging skills.
- Learn to read and understand code written by others.

## How It Works
Participants will find several code files in this repository, each containing one or more bugs. Each file corresponds to a particular programming concept or function. You must modify the code so that it executes correctly without errors.

## Languages and Tools
This challenge covers the following programming languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- C++
- Java

Feel free to use any IDE or text editor of your choice to edit and test the code.

## Sample Challenge
**Filename:** `sum_of_numbers.py`
**Problem Statement:** The function `sum_of_numbers` should return the sum of all numbers in a list, but it currently returns incorrect results.
**Expected Output:** The sum of numbers in the list `[1, 2, 3]` should be `6`.

**Original Code:**
```python
def sum_of_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in number:
        total += number
    return total
